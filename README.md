# Base

*My base SCSS file*

I've been using some form of a base CSS file for a while now. In a main CSS file, I typically import [normalize.css](https://github.com/necolas/normalize.css/), then import a base file. I've found that normalize.css is great for HTML5, form elements and certain typographic nuances.

My base file is written in SCSS and I use [Compass](http://compass-style.org/). The purpose of this file is to include global styling for a project. Here is where I would include references to all imported fonts, general type styles and default styling for elements like hyperlinks and images. I also put Sass mixins and variables here that could apply to an entire project.
